By the standards of teenagers eating McNuggets at McDonald’s, he seemed giddy. His grin was wide enough to swallow an ocean, and his foot rapidly tapped the restaurant floor.</p>\n\n<p>I took in a breath of greasy air and asked “What is it? What did you find?”</p>\n\n<p>Arjun quickly looked to the left and right. “You have to promise not to tell anyone, okay?”</p>\n\n<p>“Is it a special edition DS?” I asked. But as soon as the words left my mouth I knew that wouldn’t be it. Arjun had different priorities, very different.</p>\n\n<p>He carefully pulled something out of his pocket, but it was obscured by his fingers. Then his hand opened like a clam and showed me his secret.\nHe was holding two cigarettes.</p>\n\n<p>“Wanna try one with me?” he asked.</p>\n\n<p>“You know smoking can kill you right? Like if you get addicted?” I said.</p>\n\n<p>“Oh Arjun, smoking can kill you,” Arjun said in a mockingly high voice. “Who are you, the school principal?”</p>\n\n<p>“You know what Arjun, you can do what you want. But don’t drag me into this. You live your life, and I’ll live mine.”</p>\n\n<p>I expected Arjun to mock me further. But instead he stared at the table briefly and returned his hand to his pocket.</p>\n\n<h2>March 12, 2016</h2>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while, hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Arjun, the Chemical Engineering student.</p>\n\n<p>We were walking together between the buildings of the University campus. On the far left was an aging building with a red brick facade, on the far right was a structure of shining glass and gleaming steel. Closer to us were trees with colorful leaves, and tbe tiled road below our shoes. As out hour long conversation was drawing to a close, I was heading to the bus stop, and he joined me.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, ever since we switched programs, we never seemed to run into each other,&rdquo; said I, the Electrical Engineering student.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yo, have you been drinking?&rdquo; Arjun asked.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Nah, I don&rsquo;t drink,&rdquo; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t smoke either, guess it suits you,&rdquo; Arjun said. &ldquo;By the way, you don&rsquo;t mind me having a quick smoke here do you? Got to be outside the building and all that.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I rolled my eyes. &ldquo;Sure, whatever, as long as I&rsquo;m upwind from you.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>My old friend pulled out his lighter and a cigarette. I pulled out my Apple iPhone SE to play <em>Threes</em>. I wasn&rsquo;t even particularly skilled, nor did it give me any sense of wonder. Yet in terms of sheer time spent, <em>Threes</em> was my favorite pastime.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Any plans to quit?&rdquo; I asked without looking up from my phone.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;How else am I going to get the edge off in this fucking engineering program?&rdquo; said Arjun.</p>\n\n<p>We stood around in silence for a minute or so.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You seriously don&rsquo;t drink beer?&rdquo; asked Arjun.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, why do you ask?&rdquo; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s totally a beer belly though!&rdquo; he said. Then he shifted to a less excited tone. &ldquo;Sorry to be rude, just something that popped in my head.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I looked down briefly at my expanding gut. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know what to tell you man, it&rsquo;s all poutine and cola.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Arjun turned away and exhaled. A wisp of hot smoke melted into the cold autumn air.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Other reason I was asking, was that me, Anjali, Abishek, and the others were all planning to go to the bar later. Want to come with?&rdquo; he asked.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d be happy to see you.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite nice of you. But no thanks. I&rsquo;d have to take a later bus to Toronto,&rdquo; I replied. I was on co-op and Arjun wasn&rsquo;t, so I was working in Toronto during Arjun&rsquo;s study term.</p>\n\n<p>Arjun nodded gravely, then returned to his excited self.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Well, have a good trip! See you again sometime!&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n<p>I walked away from the trees, and campus buildings and Arjun. I climbed into the top floor of the GO Bus, and waved down at Arjun. He smiled and waved back, then went on his way.</p>\n\n<p>I returned to my game of <em>Threes</em>, and hoped the local burger place would still be open when I got back.</p>\n\n<h2>March 12, 2019</h2>\n\n<p>I sat in the Grand River Transit bus, and prepared to start yet another game of <em>Threes</em>. But I noticed a familiar face in a nearby seat.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Hey Abishek, how are things?&rdquo; I said, as I sat next to Arjun&rsquo;s old friend.</p>\n\n<p>Abishek stroked his beard carefully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good, I guess,&rdquo; he said without smiling. &ldquo;I was just on my way to the GO bus stop. How about you?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just grabbing a Popeye&rsquo;s before I get home.&rdquo; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Working hard?&rdquo; asked Abishek with a smirk. &ldquo;Or hardly working?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Well, you know me.&rdquo; I said, shrugging.</p>\n\n<p>Abishek pursed his lips and stayed silent for a second.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Did you hear about Arjun?&rdquo; asked Abishek.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No, how&rsquo;s he doing?&rdquo; I responded.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s passeed away,&rdquo; Abishek said.</p>\n\n<p>For a moment, I stopped breathing. I felt a wave of grief crash upon my mind.</p>\n\n<p>Arjun was dead. He was barely through his twenties, he didn&rsquo;t even finish university, and he was dead.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It was lung cancer,&rdquo; Abishek continued. &ldquo;The funeral was just last week.&rdquo;\nArjun died. He died and I wasn&rsquo;t there, not even for his funeral. That was the second wave of grief, the realization that we had drifted so far apart.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; I said. I didn&rsquo;t know what else to say.</p>\n\n<p>I got off the bus at Popeye&rsquo;s, ordered a 4 piece platter, paid with debit, and left with the massive plastic bag in hand. I headed home and sat in front of my laptop.</p>\n\n<p>My &ldquo;home&rdquo; felt empty. I technically lived with roommates, but we hardly talked or even used the shared living spaces. Not that it mattered, I chose the place for the internet and location.</p>\n\n<p>My Apple iPhone 11 buzzed. It was a text from a scammer: the main sort of notification I got from that slab of metal.</p>\n\n<p>I opened YouTube and planned to spend the night the same way I did most other nights: relaxing while leaving academic and social concerns for later.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, I cried.</p>\n\n<h2>Feedback from The Joy of Writing group</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>nice descriptions, humor</li>\n<li>add a little more of tech obsession, a little more addiction</li>\n<li>instead of dates, tell passage of time another way</li>\n<li>&ldquo;it was three years later&rdquo;</li>\n<li>or tell with iphone version numbers</li>\n<li>emphasize what&rsquo;s going on</li>\n<li>narrator addicted - please make it clearer</li>\n<li>trilogy of symbol: DS, phone, phone (like pens and marker)</li>\n<li>waves of grief is a cliche, more explicit feel, material action - imply the emotion, don&rsquo;t just say it</li>\n<li>diary entry more immediate</li>\n<li>3rd vignette: switch games again to something more depressing, Solitaire maybe</li>\n</ul>","attachments":[{"url":"http://www.ratan.blog/j-smoking/attachments/thumbnail.svg","mime_type":"image/svg+xml"}],"tags":["creative","joy of writing"],"_ratan_blog_class":"swit "}
