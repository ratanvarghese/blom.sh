It was fun, it was exciting, and yes, I was &ldquo;MOVED&rdquo;. I liked the protagonists. I liked the antagonists. I liked the supporting cast. I liked the quips. I liked the awkwardness of being a teenager with larger than life problems.  I liked the fights.</p>\n\n<p>I especially liked how this was a superhero story about the working class, instead of about billionaires, government experiments and gods. I especially liked how the Avengers are an institution now, a new pillar of the military industrial complex.</p>\n\n<p>Marvel needed Spider-Man&rsquo;s comeback to be excellent. They succeeded.
