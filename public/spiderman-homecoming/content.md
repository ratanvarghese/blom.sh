I'm not going to do the bullet point thing, but this movie was great. It was fun, it was exciting, and yes, I was "MOVED". I liked the protagonists. I liked the antagonists. I liked the supporting cast. I liked the quips. I liked the awkwardness of being a teenager with larger than life problems.  I liked the fights.

I especially liked how this was a superhero story about the working class, instead of about billionaires, government experiments and gods. I especially liked how the Avengers are an institution now, a new pillar of the military industrial complex.

Marvel needed Spider-Man's comeback to be excellent. They succeeded. Go see it before someone spoils it, go quick, **GO**!
