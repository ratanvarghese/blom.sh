She had to be imagining - it simply couldn&rsquo;t be a</strong> floppy disk.</p>\n\n<p>Not that Miranda, at the tender age of thirteen, even knew the term &ldquo;floppy disk&rdquo;. Her first thought was that it might be a 3D-printed sculpture of the &ldquo;Save&rdquo; icon on her word processor. But Phoebe, knowledgeable, cultured Phoebe, rolled her eyes and explained.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a storage device from like 1980-something,&rdquo; said Phoebe as waves crashed behind her. &ldquo;Kind of like a USB stick.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s a USB stick?&rdquo; asked Miranda. Miranda blushed as she looked into Phoebe&rsquo;s eyes for something other than annoyance.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Back when phones and the internet were dogshit, you could use these devices to move stuff from one computer to another,&rdquo; Phoebe said. But her dry voice turned more fluffy and gentle as she continued. &ldquo;I only know this &lsquo;cause my mom told me. It&rsquo;s kind of useless these days if I&rsquo;m being honest. We aren&rsquo;t archaeologists, right?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Phoebe smiled at Miranda and noticed Miranda&rsquo;s slow exhale, her reddened cheeks, her upper teeth upon her lower lip. Was ignorance of floppy disks Miranda&rsquo;s only source of embarassment?</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What if we were archaeologists?&rdquo; asked Miranda. &ldquo;What treasures would we discover together?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>She breathed in the mixture of fresh sea air and Phoebe&rsquo;s sweet perfume, while admiring the sunset atop Phoebe&rsquo;s red, lustrous hair.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find out,&rdquo; Phoebe said. She took Miranda&rsquo;s hand and they ran across the beach together, back to Phoebe&rsquo;s house on the shore. Miranda had no idea what would happen next, but if it was with Phoebe, did it really matter?</p>\n\n<p>That said, it was a bit of a disappointment that they spent their evening trying to actually read their antique device. After hours of plugging in the wrong cables into a decrepit beige box, the girls were finally able to view the <code>PARTY.JPEG</code> older than the two of them combined.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah we should definitely party after - OH FUCK!&rdquo; Phoebe said.</p>\n\n<p>The decades-old image was of Phoebe&rsquo;s mom, grinning in the nude with three male companions.</p>\n\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n\n<p>The bolded sentences are from the &ldquo;Complete the Story&rdquo; writing prompt book.
