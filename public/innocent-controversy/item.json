Obviously, on a subreddit with a broad range of content, the Controversial page might actually contain some real-world controversy. Political subreddits, which are already inherently controversial, would probably have even more extreme content their Controversial page.</p>\n\n<p>However, I was curious about more innocent, focused subreddits. What posts would earn split opinions on subreddits with a narrow focus on a non-controversial topic? Join me, dear reader, on a trek through the friendly, affable corners of this hive of scum and villainy.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that controversy is determined by the norms of a community. Reading the comments on these posts can often be helpful for understanding why OP was considered so polarizing.</p>\n\n<p>Post titles are prefixed with their position on the &ldquo;Most Controversial post of all time&rdquo; page of their subreddit.</p>\n\n<h3><span id=\"/r/aww\">/r/aww</span></h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"/innocent-controversy/attachments/aww.jpeg\" alt=\"r/aww\" /> <span class=\"credit\">Image credit: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/users/amayaeguizabal-151412/\">amayaeguizabal on Pixabay</a></span></p>\n\n<p>A subreddit where millions of people collaborate to find cute pictures of babies and small animals. What could possibly be <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/controversial/\">controversial</a> in a community like this?</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"3: look what my girlfriend made me.\">3: look what my girlfriend made me.</span></h4>\n\n<p>That is one way to describe the <a href=\"https://redd.it/1brgj9\">situation</a> but I&rsquo;m sure if OP picked a less roundabout title many a downvote could have been avoided.</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"4: Rescued this pup...\">4: Rescued this pup&hellip;</span></h4>\n\n<p>It is amazing that OP lied multiple times in a single sentence. Truly masterful. <a href=\"https://redd.it/p68fw\">The post</a> really caused a bit of comment drama, leading to some debate (read: one-sided shouting) about the true nature and ideals of /r/aww.</p>\n\n<p>None of it was cute.</p>\n\n<p><em>EDIT 54-F26: obviously a joke lol</em></p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"15: I'm convinced my friend's new puppy can break Reddit...\">15: I&rsquo;m convinced my friend&rsquo;s new puppy can break Reddit&hellip;</span></h4>\n\n<p>/r/aww just <a href=\"https://redd.it/1e3xsm\">doesn&rsquo;t get it</a>. Viral marketing skills are much, much more cute than any puppy will ever be! I don&rsquo;t know about you, but when OP spells out how (s)he&rsquo;s a cynical karma farmer, it makes my heart flutter.</p>\n\n<h3><span id=\"/r/ImaginaryDragons\">/r/ImaginaryDragons</span></h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"/innocent-controversy/attachments/imaginarydragons.png\" alt=\"r/ImaginaryDragons\" /> <span class=\"credit\">Image credit: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/users/jes872148-45991/\">jes872148 on Pixabay</a></span></p>\n\n<p>Sorry dracologists, this subreddit is focused on <em>imaginary</em> dragons <em>only</em>: real dragons need not apply. So what makes a dragon <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryDragons/controversial/\">controversial</a>? Poor drawing skills and sultry gazes, most of the time. However there were some dragons on that page which were truly beyond imagining.</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"4: Elite Dragon...\">4: Elite Dragon&hellip;</span></h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://redd.it/3yr1sb\">This dragon</a> is nothing short of majestic. Tough. Agile. Strong. I don&rsquo;t know why the post has any downvotes at all.</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"10: Oberon, a Royal Shoulder Dragon UNBOXING...\">10: Oberon, a Royal Shoulder Dragon UNBOXING&hellip;</span></h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://redd.it/45la74\">This video</a> was really informative. It cleared up some of my misconceptions about dragons. I had always assumed that dragons hatched from eggs but it appears that dragon embryos reside in boxes until they are mature enough to sit on shoulders. Futhermore the draconian skeletal system utilizes &ldquo;pose-able&rdquo; wire as well as bone. Unfortunately this post was perhaps too real for the <em>imaginary</em> dragon community.</p>\n\n<h3><span id=\"/r/mechanical_gifs\">/r/mechanical_gifs</span></h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"/innocent-controversy/attachments/mechanical_gifs.png\" alt=\"r/mechanical_gifs\" /> <span class=\"credit\">Image credit: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/it/users/stux-12364/\">stux on Pixabay</a></span></p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s usually not the machines that are <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanical_gifs/controversial/\">controversial</a> but the presentation.</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"1: Lego Rube Goldberg Machine\">1: Lego Rube Goldberg Machine</span></h4>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s really great when <a href=\"https://redd.it/55zy1u\">everything a machine does</a> is summarized in a single GIF. Not a gear nor pulley left to the imagination.</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"4: How It's Made: Gears\">4: How It&rsquo;s Made: Gears</span></h4>\n\n<p>The explanatory power of the internet is <a href=\"https://redd.it/6odup0\">truly astounding</a>. There&rsquo;s so much knowledge out there, provided in easy to understand formats. We&rsquo;re blessed, we citizens of the 21st century.</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"5: Animation of Newton's Cradle (CSS...\">5: Animation of Newton&rsquo;s Cradle (CSS&hellip;</span></h4>\n\n<p>Why would anyone try to make a physically accurate GIF <a href=\"https://redd.it/42lgj3\">in CSS</a>? Actually, it looks like using another language to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@dtinth/spring-animation-in-css-2039de6e1a03\">generate the CSS</a> might have made this post work.</p>\n\n<h3><span id=\"/r/OddlySatisfying\">/r/OddlySatisfying</span></h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"/innocent-controversy/attachments/oddlysatisfying.jpg\" alt=\"r/OddlySatisfying\" /> <span class=\"credit\">Image credit: <a href=\"https://pixnio.com/objects/metal-spinning-top-focus-gold-instrument-marble-metal\">Ash @ModernAfflatus on Pixnio</a></span></p>\n\n<p>A relatively large subreddit, focused on pursuing a deep sense of calm through the use of GIFs and JPEGs. Shouldn&rsquo;t that be antithetical to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/controversial/\">controversy</a>? Well, think again.</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"3: A Perfect Split\">3: A Perfect Split</span></h4>\n\n<p>You know what&rsquo;s more satisfying than perfection? An appreciation for perfection. That&rsquo;s why after seeing this GIF, you should <a href=\"https://redd.it/30lwb4\">peruse the comments</a>.</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"13: The way this pen ran out of ink\">13: The way this pen ran out of ink</span></h4>\n\n<p>Despite the neat aesthetic, I cannot help but feel bad for the writer in <a href=\"https://redd.it/234l44\">this situation</a>. For more reasons than one, all the neatness was for naught.</p>\n\n<h3><span id=\"/r/pokemon\">/r/pokemon</span></h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"/innocent-controversy/attachments/pokemon.png\" alt=\"r/pokemon\" /> <span class=\"credit\">Image credit: Nintendo, Game Freak</span></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/controversial/\">Yes</a>.</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"3: Keep this post at 666 upvotes and Lord helix will...\">3: Keep this post at 666 upvotes and Lord helix will&hellip;</span></h4>\n\n<p>&hellip;No he won&rsquo;t, because /r/pokemon <a href=\"https://redd.it/5ad41g\">didn&rsquo;t live up to his demands</a>. A demonstration of the mechanics of the &ldquo;Controversial&rdquo; rating on Reddit: this was clearly a much loved post, but the whole point was to gather many upvotes and downvotes.</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"10: ...My friends have shunned me...\">10: &hellip;My friends have shunned me&hellip;</span></h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://redd.it/1oqsvl\">He found new ones on the internet</a>. /r/aww&hellip;</p>\n\n<h3><span id=\"/r/PutAnEggOnIt\">/r/PutAnEggOnIt</span></h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"/innocent-controversy/attachments/putaneggonit.jpg\" alt=\"r/putaneggonit\" /> <span class=\"credit\">Image credit: /r/putaneggonit</span></p>\n\n<p>Now, if you visit the home page of the subreddit, there&rsquo;s no indication that a &ldquo;Controversial&rdquo; page even exists. But <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PutAnEggOnIt/controversial/\">here it is</a>. In fact, even /r/wholesomememes has a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/controversial/\">hidden controversial page</a>. Amazingly enough, /r/wholesomememes is not narrowly-defined enough to stem the tide of real controversies, unlike /r/PutAnEggOnIt.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, the /r/PutAnEggOnIt description states that &ldquo;You are especially welcome if you&rsquo;ve been banned from /r/food&rdquo;. Apparently posts with the phrase &ldquo;Grilled Cheese&rdquo; are automatically banned from /r/food. Harsh!</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"1: Hot chicken sandwich\">1: Hot chicken sandwich</span></h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://redd.it/6y79e1\">This post</a> is safe for work but is it safe for life?</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"2: ...Shameless plug, follow my Instagram!\">2: &hellip;Shameless plug, follow my Instagram!</span></h4>\n\n<p>If you think the <a href=\"https://redd.it/71owdb\">plug</a> is shameless, wait until you see the name of the Instagram.</p>\n\n<h3><span id=\"/r/Raining\">/r/Raining</span></h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"/innocent-controversy/attachments/raining.jpeg\" alt=\"r/raining\" /> <span class=\"credit\">Image credit: <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/@veeterzy/\">veeterzy on Pexels</a></span></p>\n\n<p>Believe it or not, this is not the only subreddit focused on weather. Now, precipitation can be annoying, but can it really be <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raining/controversial/\">controversial</a>?</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"1: Found on r/furry, but I know you guys will like it\">1: Found on r/furry, but I know you guys will like it</span></h4>\n\n<p>Yes, <a href=\"https://redd.it/3uic5e\">this post</a> is safe for work: the animal-human hybrids are both fully clothed. They&rsquo;re sharing a beer though, so whoever is in charge of age-rating pictures of rain should keep that in mind.</p>\n\n<p>This is a real gem. First of all, why would anyone bring furry art to /r/raining? Yes, there is some rain in the background, but that&rsquo;s clearly not the focus of the image. Secondly, the post title claimed &ldquo;I know you guys will like it&rdquo;, but the post ended up being the most controversial raining-related thing on the internet. I hope OP learned to read a crowd after this debacle.</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"3: Rain\">3: Rain</span></h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://redd.it/3otvdq\">Flawless logic</a>.</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"14: /r/Raining is creeping me out right now\">14: /r/Raining is creeping me out right now</span></h4>\n\n<p>You know, many people are concerned about the New World Order conspiring to rule over us all, but clearly there are positives to their campaign of surveillance and control. Is there a better time than <a href=\"https://redd.it/6xmhqm\">this</a> to learn about the existence of /r/raining? I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I think I&rsquo;ll be swapping out my tinfoil hat for an umbrella, if you know what I mean.</p>","attachments":[{"url":"http://www.ratan.blog/innocent-controversy/attachments/aww.jpeg","mime_type":"image/jpeg"},{"url":"http://www.ratan.blog/innocent-controversy/attachments/imaginarydragons.png","mime_type":"image/png"},{"url":"http://www.ratan.blog/innocent-controversy/attachments/mechanical_gifs.png","mime_type":"image/png"},{"url":"http://www.ratan.blog/innocent-controversy/attachments/oddlysatisfying.jpg","mime_type":"image/jpeg"},{"url":"http://www.ratan.blog/innocent-controversy/attachments/pokemon.png","mime_type":"image/png"},{"url":"http://www.ratan.blog/innocent-controversy/attachments/putaneggonit.jpg","mime_type":"image/jpeg"},{"url":"http://www.ratan.blog/innocent-controversy/attachments/raining.jpeg","mime_type":"image/jpeg"}],"tags":["nonsense"],"_ratan_blog_class":""}
