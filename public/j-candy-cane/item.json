Like many things in my life, these summer nights wouldn&rsquo;t last much longer. I sat quietly on a</strong> bench in the park, thinking about how this was the worst possible time to be entering the candy cane business.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The investors are going to think I&rsquo;m joking,&rdquo; I said aloud. &ldquo;What was I even thinking?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I held my masked head in my hands.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a global pandemic, an economic crisis, Halloween is probably cancelled, the competition is a million years old and here I am trying to break into the confectionary business. They&rsquo;re gonna eat me alive like it&rsquo;s <em>Shark Tank</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I closed my eyes tight and shook my head in frustration. My mind swirled with emotion like a hurricane, wrecking and flooding all rational thought. I was so distraught that I didn&rsquo;t notice the footsteps of the only other person on the empty trail.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; asked an old man, possibly in violation of self-quarantine. He was rather overweight and clad in a red tracksuit. His white beard was magnificent, larger even than his face. A red mask covered his nose and mouth, but his eyes shone with kindness.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I spend my credit and life savings on a terrible business idea,&rdquo; I told him.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve been there. Reindeer herding didn&rsquo;t work out too well for me,&rdquo; the old man said. &ldquo;What business are you in?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Candy. Holiday-themed candy. I had a custom candy-cane colouring machine and everything. Could put the name of your kid or whatever on the cane.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;A custom message in a candy cane for all the good boys, girls and nonbinary children?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, but nobody will ever buy it, who&rsquo;d even want that?&rdquo; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Ho-ho-ho,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose hope just yet young man. I know some people who would find that device quite useful. Here, take my card.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He handed me the card and jogged away. I stared at the card, first in desperation, then confusion. It had only a number, and the name</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>NICOLAS</p></blockquote>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h3>\n\n<p>The bolded sentences are from the &ldquo;Complete the Story&rdquo; writing prompt book. I tried combining those sentences with Joy of Writing&rsquo;s prompt, &ldquo;Candy Cane&rdquo;.</p>","attachments":[{"url":"http://www.ratan.blog/j-candy-cane/attachments/thumbnail.svg","mime_type":"image/svg+xml"}],"tags":["creative","joy of writing"],"_ratan_blog_class":"swit "}
