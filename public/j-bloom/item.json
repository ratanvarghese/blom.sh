No, not circle shaped. It was an oval shaped pond.</p>\n\n<p>I know shapes.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s it all dark?&rdquo; I asked Mom. &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t there any fish in the pond?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Mom put her hand on her head. It was hard to see her face because of her white work clothes. No, not &ldquo;work clothes&rdquo;. It was a lab coat.</p>\n\n<p>I know clothes.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a pond,&rdquo; Mom said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a algal pool. It&rsquo;s dark because there is an algal bloom happening.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Can I swim in it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Mom said.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a pool,&rdquo; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for swimming, it&rsquo;s for growing algae,&rdquo; Mom said.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s an algae?&rdquo; I asked Mom.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get to that, now come inside,&rdquo; Mom said.</p>\n\n<p>We walked into the place where Mom works. It is called a &ldquo;la-bo-ra-to-ra-bo-la&rdquo;. No, that&rsquo;s not right. Well, it&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;lab&rdquo; for short. There were many glasses. Some were cylinders, some were cones. Some were tall and thin, some were short and fat.</p>\n\n<p>I reached for a cone-shaped glass.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch my conical flask!&rdquo; Mom said. &ldquo;Ugh, I should have left you at home with Brittany.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Brittany is my babysitter. When Mom is too busy, me and Brittany watch <em>Paw Patrol</em> and play <em>Uno</em>. But <em>Uno</em> is strange with only 2 people.</p>\n\n<p>Mom is busy a lot.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Now, you were wondering what algae was,&rdquo; Mom said without looking at me. She was looking at a green juice in a cylinder glass.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I was?&rdquo; I asked. I forgot what I had asked about.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the key to saving the entire planet,&rdquo; Mom said. &ldquo;Tiny plants that live in water, that we can farm for fuel and for gruel.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><em>Gruel</em>. I shuddered. Every other day, all Mom and I eat is gruel.</p>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h3>\n\n<p>This was written in 15 minutes during a Joy of Writing meetup.</p>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Feedback from The Joy of Writing group\">Feedback from The Joy of Writing group</span></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>No mention of father</li>\n<li>Child or mentally challenged?</li>\n</ul>","attachments":[{"url":"http://www.ratan.blog/j-bloom/attachments/thumbnail.svg","mime_type":"image/svg+xml"}],"tags":["creative","joy of writing"],"_ratan_blog_class":"swit "}
