Where are the Bee Gees?</em> she thought.</p>\n\n<p>She looked closer at the shelf of vinyls in vain. <em>All of them Beatles?</em> she thought. <em>Really?</em></p>\n\n<p>Amanda looked up from the shelf and gasped. Her toes curled in her clogs. Marcus was right next to her, silent like a spectre.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Hey Marcus,&rdquo; Amanda said. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t see you there.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Hi Amanda,&rdquo; he said calmly, as always. His dorky shirt, and they were always dorky, depicted a supersonic aircraft.</p>\n\n<p><em>When will this guy learn to dress himself?</em> Amanda thought. But instead of saying that, she simply remarked &ldquo;Interesting shirt.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Why thank you,&rdquo; Marcus responded, even though Amanda technically hadn&rsquo;t complimented him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Concorde, if you must know.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Amanda rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Can you help me find &lsquo;Stayin Alive&rsquo; by the Bee Gees?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Marcus and Amanda searched the record store shelf by shelf. She talked about the energy crisis, the Soviet-Afghan war, and her job prospects.\nHe talked about the UNIX operating system and his recent trip to see his brother out of town.</p>\n\n<p>But here and there he would pepper in one of those annoying questions.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;So Amanda, how&rsquo;s your boyfriend doing?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he like?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You know, this is a bit late, but you never told me your boyfriend&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>And Amanda would respond.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s doing his Master&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;He knows a lot about history.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;His name is Timothy.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>And each time she responded, Marcus' face would briefly twist into a scowl, or his eyes would dart wildly. But Marcus always tried to return to his neutral tone, his unnaturally gentle smile.</p>\n\n<p><em>Marcus, you idiot,</em> thought Amanda. <em>Who are you trying to fool?</em></p>\n\n<p>Eventually Amanda and Marcus walked up to the desk of the record store in frustration.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Where are the <em>Bee Gees</em>?&rdquo; Amanda asked.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Sorry ma'am, the boss is all about the <em>Beatles</em>,&rdquo; the cashier responded.</p>\n\n<p>Amanda held her hands in frustration, which was definitely not the perfect time for Marcus to step in.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;So Timothy, is he more of a <em>Bee Gees</em> guy like you?&rdquo; Marcus asked.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Can you shut up about Timothy!?&rdquo; demanded Amanda. &ldquo;You have a problem with him? Then just spit it out!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just curious about his taste in music,&rdquo; Marcus lied.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Goddamn it Marcus. Just let me live, just let me be.&rdquo; Amanda said.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Look Amanda, I only accused him of being a Soviet spy <em>two or three times at most</em> so can we get over that?&rdquo;</p>","attachments":[{"url":"http://www.ratan.blog/j-seventies/attachments/thumbnail.svg","mime_type":"image/svg+xml"}],"tags":["creative","joy of writing"],"_ratan_blog_class":"swit "}
