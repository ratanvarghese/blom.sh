I visited Ottawa recently to stay with my aunts and their families, and also to get to Parliament Hill for the Canada 150 concert.

 - The crowds were pretty thick by Ottawa standards...

 - There were stories of immigrants posted downtown.

 - A speech by the Prince of Wales was going on while we were walking downtown.
 - There were lots of trained stilt walkers.

 - On Parliament Hill, it was burning hot throughout the afternoon.
 - I stood on the stone fence of the Parliament... until the guards told people to get down.

 - The view was ok while it lasted.

 - Many presenters, even the ones that weren't explicitly anti-colonial, made it a point to mention that Ottawa was built on Algonquin land.
 - SNOW BIRDS: apparently Serena Ryder tours with these jets all the time :D

 - Can you identify this flying object?

 - The rain came fast, but most were prepared.

 - There were some *charming* details you'd miss if you saw this on TV.

 - The evening events were delayed for a long time, everyone got drenched. The organizers seeded false hope by starting an announcement every few minutes ... just to tell everyone that events were delayed "due to weather".
 - A group of ravers on the side of the stage started singing the national anthem a few times while the organizers failed to deliver. It was really touching.
 - They also sang *Hakuna Matata*.
 - My fam and I left the scene at 21:00 as there was nothing going on, so we didn't get to see Cirque du Soleil or the fireworks.
