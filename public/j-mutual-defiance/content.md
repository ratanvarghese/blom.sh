"So how does the scoring work in this game again?" asked Lucy, on my left. "One point each time you play the highest card?"

"Highest of the suit," said James, on my right. "But if you don't correctly predict the points you'll get in a trick, you lose points."

"I for one predict total loss," I said sarcastically while looking at my hand. After all, the four of clubs was not high value at all.

James predicted one win, Lucy predicted total loss, Karthik predicted two wins, and Lisa predicted three wins. Then the trick of *Wizard* commenced.

When James started with his ace of spades, I responded with my five of spades. "Oh no, I correctly predicted that I'm a total loser," I said, as James carefully collected the cards that earned him a point.

Karthik played two Wizards in a row: his prediction of two wins came true. With so few Wizards left, Lisa was able to sweep through three rounds with her aces and kings.

We each had only one card left. Lisa's was the two of clubs. James and Karthik played cards that weren't clubs and were thus, useless. But Lucy's card was probably a club, since she hadn't any card of any other suit during the entire trick. No wonder she predicted total loss.

"I guess I lost this one," I said in mock despair. "Woe is me." I played my four of clubs and waited for Lucy to play the Queen or ten or whatever else.

"Not if I lose this hand first," said Lucy defiantly, as she placed the three of clubs on the table.

I slapped my forehead and said, "Seriously?"

I won the hand and lost the trick. I won the battle and lost the war.
