I hope he didn&rsquo;t see that.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Will you feel like going to the office <em>after</em> your arm gets broken?&rdquo; I asked. And I couldn&rsquo;t help myself, the horrifying train of thought had already left the ghastly station.</p>\n\n<p>Jason&rsquo;s arm would be pretty simple to break.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;ll be okay, I&rsquo;ve lived here for a year and haven&rsquo;t gotten into any trouble.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I noticed a suspicious gleam from my pant leg. My concealed pistol wasn&rsquo;t quite concealed enough.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Look Jason,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of danger in the world, and it would make me feel a lot better if you had health insurance.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You mean like a bus hitting me?&rdquo; Jason asked.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Sure, yeah,&rdquo; I responded.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I rarely leave the house anyway,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n<p>I couldn&rsquo;t tell him the truth. I couldn&rsquo;t tell him because it would put him, and me, in even more danger.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard of the organized crime in this city?&rdquo; I asked Jason.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;But I just sit in my apartment and order in food from Uber,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why would they be interested in little old me?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n\n<p>This was written in 15 minutes during a Joy of Writing meetup.</p>\n\n<h2>Feedback from the Joy of Writing group</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>don&rsquo;t use adverbs too much: your setting and language and characterization should tell the story.</li>\n<li>&ldquo;glumly&rdquo;</li>\n<li>swifties: one line with adverb which is a pun</li>\n</ul>","attachments":[{"url":"http://www.ratan.blog/j-insurance/attachments/thumbnail.svg","mime_type":"image/svg+xml"}],"tags":["creative","joy of writing"],"_ratan_blog_class":"swit "}
