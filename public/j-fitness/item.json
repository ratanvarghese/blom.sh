If you must know, I was sipping from the original, thank you very much.</p>\n\n<p>He was the youngest person in the company, a co-op from University of Toronto. Or maybe they don&rsquo;t refer to their internships as co-ops, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m barely a Torontonian.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Oh not much to be honest,&rdquo; I said. I looked past Greg for a moment to take in the scenes of the office Christmas party. God this party was boring, bunch of middle-aged couples in wearing &lsquo;business casual&rsquo; talking about their mortgage and their kids. This so-called party took forever to get to. I strongly considered not showing up next year.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been playing a lot of tennis,&rdquo; said Greg. &ldquo;Well, at least I&rsquo;m going to see a tennis coach.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty interesting,&rdquo; I said, uninterested. But at least Greg was roughly my age, if you count decade by decade. I kind of knew where he was coming from most of the time. But sometimes I just had to play pretend.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What can I say? Gotta stay fit somehow,&rdquo; said Greg. &ldquo;Either this or my mom would march me to a gym.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Would my mom march me to a gym if I still lived with her? Perhaps, but if I stayed on her continent then I would have missed out on this <em>amazing</em> party. Amazing, measured by the amount of boredom produced.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t do any sports or anything like that?&rdquo; asked Greg.</p>\n\n<p><em>Damnit Greg, how do I communicate to you that I&rsquo;d prefer to talk about something else, without just blurting that out?</em> I thought.</p>\n\n<p>And then I wondered what I was so worried about. The other employees of the company? Would they even care? Would they even care, if I typed out all their precious Unicode characters and generated their binaries to manipulate binary, their symbols to generate symbols.</p>\n\n<p>No, that feeling of dread and emptiness was not from them.</p>\n\n<p>It was from me.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Maybe I should do something like that,&rdquo; I told Greg. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t right now, but you&rsquo;re absolutely right.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><em>You&rsquo;re absolutely right</em>. It stung like a needle, admitting that there was something wrong with me and right about Greg.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Is your tennis coach any good?&rdquo; I asked.</p>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h3>\n\n<p>This was written in 15 minutes during a Joy of Writing meetup.</p>","attachments":[{"url":"http://www.ratan.blog/j-fitness/attachments/thumbnail.svg","mime_type":"image/svg+xml"}],"tags":["creative","joy of writing"],"_ratan_blog_class":"swit "}
