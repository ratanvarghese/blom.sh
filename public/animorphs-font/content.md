--*A message found on the blurb of most __Animorphs__ books. The blurbs, of course, used a more conventional font.*

If you want to __morph__ your text, you can get this font __[here](https://my.pcloud.com/publink/show?code=XZsGMGZSUosnd0Gsdf77ByxFCAgs4Q5N8sy)__, and discuss it __[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animorphs/comments/6i2h4p/animorphs_font/)__.

It's obviously not the best choice for body text, but I'm sure a designer with __restraint__ could make it work. I'm pretty sure this is a fan-created font imitating the one Scholastic made, but it does raise the question of what the people designing the covers were going for.

It looks as alien as a font can while still being readable English. It is also fairly distinctive. Anything __Animorphs__-related could be recognized with a single letter.

Yeah, good luck pulling __that__ off with Helvetica...

Scholastic actually had other distinct, alien-ish fonts for this series. As you can see, __Visser__ had its own font seperate from the standard __Animorphs__ one (as it deserves ... though perhaps that font is used elsewhere). Also notice K.A. Applegate's name at the bottom: Scholastic at the very least had a significant fraction of the alphabet ready to print in their version of the font, not just the word __"Animorphs"__. The __[reprints](http://animorphs.wikia.com/wiki/Relaunch)__ have their own cover font __but I try not to think about them... about the things they have ruined...__ (the reprint changes are almost purely aesthetic, but none of them are welcome).

As you might have guessed, in the actual content of the books, typography is hardly mentioned. __There was just no time.__ I don't think they even bash Comic Sans, as the Comic Sans hatedom had not yet __escaped their homeworld and spread, like a plague, across the galaxy.__

__EDIT (53-D08):__ The font used in the actual books is called 1979, you can preview it __[here](https://www.dafont.com/1979.font)__.
