Even you.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>&ndash;<em>A message found on the blurb of most <strong>Animorphs</strong> books. The blurbs, of course, used a more conventional font.</em></p>\n\n<p>If you want to <strong>morph</strong> your text, you can get this font <strong><a href=\"https://my.pcloud.com/publink/show?code=XZsGMGZSUosnd0Gsdf77ByxFCAgs4Q5N8sy\">here</a></strong>, and discuss it <strong><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Animorphs/comments/6i2h4p/animorphs_font/\">here</a></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s obviously not the best choice for body text, but I&rsquo;m sure a designer with <strong>restraint</strong> could make it work. I&rsquo;m pretty sure this is a fan-created font imitating the one Scholastic made, but it does raise the question of what the people designing the covers were going for.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/animorphs-font/attachments/ani1.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of Animorphs #1\" /></p>\n\n<p>It looks as alien as a font can while still being readable English. It is also fairly distinctive. Anything <strong>Animorphs</strong>-related could be recognized with a single letter.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/animorphs-font/attachments/animorphs-a.jpg\" alt=\"Animorphs compact logo\" /></p>\n\n<p>Yeah, good luck pulling <strong>that</strong> off with Helvetica&hellip;</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/animorphs-font/attachments/visser.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of Visser\" /></p>\n\n<p>Scholastic actually had other distinct, alien-ish fonts for this series. As you can see, <strong>Visser</strong> had its own font seperate from the standard <strong>Animorphs</strong> one (as it deserves &hellip; though perhaps that font is used elsewhere). Also notice K.A. Applegate&rsquo;s name at the bottom: Scholastic at the very least had a significant fraction of the alphabet ready to print in their version of the font, not just the word <strong>&ldquo;Animorphs&rdquo;</strong>. The <strong><a href=\"http://animorphs.wikia.com/wiki/Relaunch\">reprints</a></strong> have their own cover font <strong>but I try not to think about them&hellip; about the things they have ruined&hellip;</strong> (the reprint changes are almost purely aesthetic, but none of them are welcome).</p>\n\n<p>As you might have guessed, in the actual content of the books, typography is hardly mentioned. <strong>There was just no time.</strong> I don&rsquo;t think they even bash Comic Sans, as the Comic Sans hatedom had not yet <strong>escaped their homeworld and spread, like a plague, across the galaxy.</strong></p>\n\n<p>__</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT (53-D08):</strong> The font used in the actual books is called 1979, you can preview it <strong><a href=\"https://www.dafont.com/1979.font\">here</a></strong>.</p>","attachments":[{"url":"http://www.ratan.blog/animorphs-font/attachments/ani1.jpg","mime_type":"image/jpeg"},{"url":"http://www.ratan.blog/animorphs-font/attachments/animorphs-a.jpg","mime_type":"image/jpeg"},{"url":"http://www.ratan.blog/animorphs-font/attachments/visser.jpg","mime_type":"image/jpeg"}],"tags":["animorphs"],"_ratan_blog_class":"morph "}
