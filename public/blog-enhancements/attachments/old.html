<h2>Trying the Animorphs Font</h2>

<blockquote><p>We can&rsquo;t tell you who we are. Or where we live. It&rsquo;s too risky, and we&rsquo;ve got to be careful. Really careful. So we don&rsquo;t trust anyone. Because if they find us&hellip; well, we just won&rsquo;t let them find us.
The thing you&rsquo;ve got to know is that everyone is in really big trouble. Yeah. Even you.</p></blockquote>

<p>&ndash;<em>A message found on the blurb of most <strong>Animorphs</strong> books. The blurbs, of course, used a more conventional font.</em></p>

<p>If you want to <strong>morph</strong> your text, you can get this font <strong><a href="https://my.pcloud.com/publink/show?code=XZsGMGZSUosnd0Gsdf77ByxFCAgs4Q5N8sy">here</a></strong>, and discuss it <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Animorphs/comments/6i2h4p/animorphs_font/">here</a></strong>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s obviously not the best choice for body text, but I&rsquo;m sure a designer with <strong>restraint</strong> could make it work. I&rsquo;m pretty sure this is a fan-created font imitating the one Scholastic made, but it does raise the question of what the people designing the covers were going for.</p>

<p>It looks as alien as a font can while still being readable English. It is also fairly distinctive. Anything <strong>Animorphs</strong>-related could be recognized with a single letter.</p>

<p>Yeah, good luck pulling <strong>that</strong> off with Helvetica&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/animorphs-font/attachments/visser.jpg" alt="Cover of Visser" /></p>

<p>Scholastic actually had other distinct, alien-ish fonts for this series. As you can see, <strong>Visser</strong> had its own font seperate from the standard <strong>Animorphs</strong> one (as it deserves &hellip; though perhaps that font is used elsewhere). Also notice K.A. Applegate&rsquo;s name at the bottom: Scholastic at the very least had a significant fraction of the alphabet ready to print in their version of the font, not just the word <strong>&ldquo;Animorphs&rdquo;</strong>. The <strong><a href="http://animorphs.wikia.com/wiki/Relaunch">reprints</a></strong> have their own cover font <strong>but I try not to think about them&hellip; about the things they have ruined&hellip;</strong> (the reprint changes are almost purely aesthetic, but none of them are welcome).</p>

<p>As you might have guessed, in the actual content of the books, typography is hardly mentioned. <strong>There was just no time.</strong> I don&rsquo;t think they even bash Comic Sans, as the Comic Sans hatedom had not yet <strong>escaped their homeworld and spread, like a plague, across the galaxy.</strong></p>
