Recently, I met some friends I hadn't seen in years, to watch a movie series I hadn't looked at in decades.

Speculation walking in

 - Some discussion of the artificial nature of the cars. Are they ... built?
 - Is Jackson Storm an electric vehicle? IS HE A TESLA?

The pre-movie

 - A Canadian Tire ad with a *Cars* tie-in. Prepare your "Meh" emojis.
 - I have never seen so many rodents near so many explosions in one trailer before.
 - [The Emoji Movie trailer is an entire movie in itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE4RoVwaQMY)
 - Trailers for various Disney and Pixar stuff, all very cool.
 - The short, [Lou](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iYsBnj2BUk), was cute

The actual movie

 - Lightning McQueen, the *original* self-driving car. Known to self as "Speed".
 - Every statistical analyst should have "Certain" as a last name.
 - Geddit, his name is "Storm" and he's perfect, the perf-...
 - Jackson Storm is also a smug, self-assured jerk.
 - Crash'd
 - Sally is great at sarcasm. Was she always like this? It's been like 10 years since I've seen *Cars*...
 - Stinker, I mean Stickers.
 - Mater exists.
 - There is a statue of a car.
 - Rust-Eze Training facility... it's like a McQueen temple... BUT MCQUEEN IS NOT THE GOD!1!!!!11!
 - "Cars don't have phones."
 - McQueen is an old car who doesn't understand technology.
 - Ramirez is like ... a yoga instructor who never goes outside?
 - Bugs exist in the *Cars* universe. We never get to see them close up. Are they tiny vehicles, or like animals?
 - Using a legend to sell branded merchandise... that reminds me of [a Pixar movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille_(film))!
 - "Life's a beach."
 - We never get to see what a crab looks like in the *Cars* universe. But they're mentioned. More than once.
 - CRAZY 8
 - What do school buses do in the *Cars* universe... teach?
 - Big Data says Storm is going to win, fo sho. Our small-town, down-to-earth protagonists won't quit that easy!
 - But they will shout.
 - "Is Smoky alive?"
 - A Bar & Grill ... what do cars ... grill?
 - McQueen is an old car ... but not the *oldest* car. He has a deep respect for the wisdom of the elders.
 - Ramirez can be scary if she wants.
 - "You're old. Get over it."
 - No real driving (heh) theme behind these training sequences, but they're fun. Predictable though.
 - What are the *real* victories in life? Also, what are rules?
 - "Your blinker's on"
 - New paint jobs!
 - Hey wait a second, that Dinoco logo looks like a stylized real dinosaur not a dinosaur vehicle do fossils of dinosaurs exist in the *Cars* uni-...

Parting thoughts

 - It's good. It's not Pixar's best.
 - Felt a bit unconnected. These cars are driving about, without a GPS. Hey that makes me wonder, are satellites in orbit sentient in the *Cars* universe what about rockets what about Mars rovers did the cars make it to the moon and what ab-... /metaphor
 - It is weird for twenty-something year-old's to be in a theatre with this many children.
 - It is weird for twenty-something year-old's to see a movie about retiring with dignity.
